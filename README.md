# Store Profit Data Machine Learning with Linear Regression
Mapping Store Profit Data Points using Linear Regression Machine Learning in Python

We have a file `ext1data1.txt` that contains our dataset of our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of the city and the second column is the profit of having a store in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
